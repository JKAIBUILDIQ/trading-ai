## ⚠️ RISK FACTORS

### Execution Risks
1. **Negative Free Cash Flow** - Still in build phase
2. **High Valuation** - Forward P/E of 202x requires execution
3. **Customer Concentration** - Microsoft is anchor tenant
4. **Competition** - MARA, RIOT, CLSK also pivoting to AI
5. **Revenue Mix** - Still 97% BTC mining

### Short Interest
- **16.94% short float** - Elevated but manageable
- **Implication:** Short squeeze potential if earnings beat

### Macro Risks
- **BTC Price** - Still majority of current revenue
- **AI Spending** - If hyperscalers slow CapEx, IREN suffers
- **Interest Rates** - Affects growth stock multiples

## 💡 CLAUDIA'S ASSESSMENT

### Bull Case (40% probability)
- AI revenue beats expectations
- New customer announcement
- FY26 guidance raised
- Stock targets: $65-$75

### Base Case (35% probability)
- In-line results
- Guidance maintained
- IV crush hurts options
- Stock chops: $52-$60

### Bear Case (25% probability)
- AI delays announced
- Mining miss dominates
- Guidance cut
- Stock drops: $40-$50

### Verdict
**IREN is a legitimate infrastructure play, not just a Bitcoin miner.** The 2.9 GW power moat is real. The AI pivot is executing. The balance sheet is de-risked.

**However:** Valuation is stretched (202x forward P/E). Stock is trading above some analyst targets. This is a momentum play with real fundamental backing.

**Pre-earnings play makes sense because:**
1. IV expansion captures premium growth
2. Pre-earnings exit protects against crush
3. Keeping 30-40% allows upside participation
