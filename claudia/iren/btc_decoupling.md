## 📊 The Decoupling Thesis

### OLD NARRATIVE (2023-2024)
```
IREN = Bitcoin Mining Company
├── Stock moves with BTC (correlation ~0.80-0.85)
├── BTC up → IREN up
├── BTC down → IREN down
├── Valued as a BTC proxy / leveraged BTC play
└── Multiple based on hash rate growth
```

### NEW NARRATIVE (2025-2026)
```
IREN = AI Infrastructure Company
├── BTC mining is LEGACY business (cash cow)
├── AI datacenter is GROWTH engine
├── Power access = competitive moat (3-5 years)
├── Should trade on AI datacenter multiples
├── BTC correlation DECREASING
└── Multiple based on AI revenue growth + power moat
```

## 📈 Revenue Mix (Verified)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Current BTC Mining %** | ~97% | Research reports |
| **Current AI %** | ~3% | Research reports |
| **FY26 AI Target** | $3.4B | CoinCentral |
| **FY25 Total Revenue** | ~$501M | Company filings |

**Transition:** AI expected to become majority of revenue by end of FY26

## 📊 Today's Evidence (Jan 24, 2026)

### Price Action Comparison
```
BTC:  -0.33% (choppy, sideways)
IREN: +8.46% (strong uptrend)

If COUPLED (1.5x beta): IREN should be -0.50%
ACTUAL: IREN is +8.46%

DIVERGENCE: +8.96% → DECOUPLING CONFIRMED!
```

### Technical Indicators
| Metric | BTC | IREN | Divergence |
|--------|-----|------|------------|
| Trend | Choppy | BULLISH | ✅ IREN stronger |
| RSI(14) | ~50 | 69.1 | ✅ IREN stronger |
| 1-Month | Flat | +34.82% | ✅ IREN outperforming |

### What This Means
```
IREN is moving on its OWN fundamentals:
├── AI datacenter narrative taking hold
├── Institutional accumulation (~44% ownership)
├── Technical breakout
└── BTC is now SECONDARY indicator
```

## 🆚 Why IREN is Decoupling

### Verified Catalysts
1. **Microsoft 5-year deal** - Anchor tenant provides revenue visibility
2. **Q3 FY25 profitability** - First profitable quarter ($24.2M)
3. **$550M capital raise** - Balance sheet de-risked
4. **Hash rate pause** - Deliberate focus on AI over mining
5. **Power moat** - 2.9+ GW is scarce asset in power-constrained market

### AI Infrastructure > BTC Mining
| Factor | BTC Mining | AI Data Centers |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Margins** | Lower | Higher |
| **Revenue** | Volatile (BTC price) | Contracted (multi-year) |
| **Valuation** | Mining multiples | Infrastructure multiples |
| **Customer** | BTC network | Microsoft, hyperscalers |

## 📋 How to Trade the Decoupling

### Signal Logic
```
IREN should be traded on its OWN fundamentals:
├── IREN technicals (trend, RSI, volume)
├── AI news and customer announcements
├── Earnings results (especially AI revenue %)
└── BTC is INFORMATIONAL ONLY
```

### When to Consider BTC
```
USE BTC AS INDICATOR:
├── During BTC-specific events (halving, ETF news)
├── When correlation temporarily spikes
└── For very short-term scalping

IGNORE BTC:
├── When IREN has its own catalyst (AI news)
├── During earnings season
├── For swing trades based on IREN fundamentals
```

## 🔮 Catalyst Timeline

| Date | Catalyst | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Feb 5, 2026 | Q4 Earnings | AI revenue update |
| Q1 2026 | AI revenue growth | Decoupling validation |
| Q2 2026 | Potential new customer | High if hyperscaler |
| Q3 2026 | AI revenue > 50%? | Full decoupling |
