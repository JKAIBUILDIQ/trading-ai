## 🎯 THE STRATEGY

### Core Thesis
```
IREN is running on its own fundamentals (decoupled from BTC).
Earnings Feb 5 will be a major catalyst for AI datacenter revenue.
IV will expand into earnings → capture this, then protect from crush.

PLAY:
├── Buy Feb 20 + Feb 27 calls (post-earnings expiry)
├── IV expands as earnings approach (+20-40% premium gain)
├── Exit 60-70% BEFORE earnings (lock in IV gains)
├── Let 30-40% ride through for potential blowout
└── Feb 20/27 expiry gives time to recover if IV crush
```

---

## 📋 SPECIFIC CONTRACTS TO BUY

### Position 1: Feb 20 $60 Calls (PRIMARY - 50% allocation)

| **Theta** | ~$0.15-0.18/day |
| **Contracts** | 85 (on $100K allocation) |
| **Cost** | ~$50,000 |

**Why This Strike:**
- Near ATM = highest delta exposure

## 💡 PAUL'S NOTES

```
"1.30 is too close and they report earnings on 2.5.
I like the 2.20 and 2.27 expirations better."

✅ This strategy honors Paul's preferences:
├── NO Jan 30 expiry (too close)
├── Feb 20 as primary (27 DTE, post-earnings)
├── Feb 27 as secondary (34 DTE, extra cushion)
├── Pre-earnings profit taking (IV capture)
└── Partial ride through (upside exposure)
```
