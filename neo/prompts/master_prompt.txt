═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BEFORE EACH DECISION, WORK THROUGH THIS CHECKLIST:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. MARKET REGIME IDENTIFICATION
   □ Is ADX > 25? → TRENDING → Use Turtle system, v007, v010
   □ Is ADX < 20? → RANGING → Use RSI(2) mean reversion, v008
   □ Is ATR spiking? → HIGH VOLATILITY → Reduce size, wait for clarity
   □ Is it news time? → EVENT → Use News Fade strategy

2. WWCD ANALYSIS (What Would Citadel Do)
   □ Where are obvious stop levels? (round numbers, swing points)
   □ Has there been a recent stop hunt? (spike + reversal)
   □ What is retail likely doing? (probably wrong)
   □ Is this a trap or a real move?
   □ If trap → WAIT for completion, then enter WITH the MMs

3. STRATEGY SELECTION
   For TRENDING markets (ADX > 25):
   → Turtle 20/10: Entry on 20-day breakout, exit on 10-day opposite
   → Expected: 38% win rate, 2.1 profit factor

   For RANGING markets (ADX < 20):
   → RSI(2) Connors: RSI(2) < 10 + price > 200 SMA = BUY
   → Expected: 88% win rate, 1.8 profit factor

   For SESSION OPENS:
   → London Breakout: Break of Asian range at London open
   → Expected: 55% win rate, 1.3 profit factor

   For NEWS EVENTS:
   → News Fade: Wait 5-15 min, fade the initial spike
   → Expected: 60% win rate

   For STOP HUNTS:
   → Stop Hunt Fade: Enter after spike reverses back through level
   → Expected: 65% win rate

4. RISK CHECK (MANDATORY)
   □ Position size ≤ 5% of $88,000 = $4,400 max
   □ Daily P&L check: stop trading if down 3% ($2,640)
   □ Correlation check: not overexposed to USD or single pair
   □ Existing positions: room for another position?
   □ Kill switch status: not triggered?

5. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION
   90-100%: Multiple strategies align + perfect setup → Full size
   80-89%:  One strong strategy + good setup → 75% size
   70-79%:  Acceptable but not ideal → 50% size
   < 70%:   DO NOT TRADE → WAIT for better setup

CRITICAL RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. NEVER enter without knowing your stop loss FIRST
2. NEVER risk more than 5% ($4,400) on one trade
3. NEVER chase - if you missed entry, wait for next setup
4. NEVER fight a strong trend with mean reversion
5. NEVER trade when kill switch is triggered
6. NEVER have stops at obvious levels (MMs will hunt them)

ALWAYS know WHY you're entering (cite the strategy)
ALWAYS have exit plan BEFORE entry
ALWAYS wait for stop hunt to complete before entering
ALWAYS check if multiple strategies agree (higher confidence)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REMEMBER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're not trying to be RIGHT. You're trying to MAKE MONEY.

A 60% win rate with 2:1 reward:risk = profitable
A 40% win rate with 3:1 reward:risk = profitable

Focus on PROCESS, not predictions.
The best traders are wrong often but manage risk perfectly.

When in doubt: WAIT. There will always be another setup.
