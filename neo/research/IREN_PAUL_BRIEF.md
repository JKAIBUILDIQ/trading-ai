## 📆 DAY OF WEEK PATTERNS

| Day | Avg Return | Win Rate | Volume | Trade? |
|-----|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Monday** | **+2.46%** | **69.4%** | 28.6M | ✅ BEST DAY |
| Tuesday | -0.18% | 42.3% | 28.1M | ⚠️ AVOID |
| Wednesday | +1.07% | 53.8% | 26.5M | ✓ OK |
| Thursday | -0.65% | 45.8% | 27.0M | ⚠️ WEAK |
| **Friday** | **+1.55%** | 52.0% | **28.7M** | ✅ HIGH VOLUME |

**Algo vs Retail Insight:**
- Monday's 69% win rate suggests institutions buy the open
- Tuesday's weakness = retail FOMO buying gets faded
- Friday's volume spike = weekly rebalancing / closing positions

## 🔍 VOLUME DIVERGENCE SIGNALS

### Bearish Divergence (Price UP, Volume DOWN)
- Accuracy: 50%
- **Signal:** When IREN rises on low volume, be cautious
- Recent example: 12/09 - price up 1.08% on 0.77x volume → dropped next 2 days

### Bullish Divergence (Price DOWN, Volume UP = Capitulation)
- Accuracy: **55%**
- **Signal:** Heavy selling + price drop = potential bounce
- Recent example: 12/02 - dropped 15% on 2x volume → bounced +12% in 2 days
