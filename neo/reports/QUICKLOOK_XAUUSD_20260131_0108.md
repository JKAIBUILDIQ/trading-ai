## 🤖 AGENT REPORTS

### GHOST
**Recommendation:**  | **Confidence:** 50%

I need to clarify something important - I'm GHOST, specialized in **gold/MGC futures trading**, not stock analysis. The chart you've shown appears to be EUR/JPY forex data, and you're asking about IREN stock.

However, I can see you're asking about a stock that dropped 10% and what to look for Monday. While this is outside my gold futures specialty, here are some general considerations for gap-down scenarios:

**For Monday's Session:**
- **Gap Fill Potential**: Look for possible gap fill back to

### CASPER
**Recommendation:** BUY | **Confidence:** 50%

## CASPER RISK MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS - IREN

**EXPOSURE:** HEAVY (Given 10% single-day drop indicates significant position)
**RISK LEVEL:** HIGH 
**DE-RISK ACTION:** SCALE OUT / TIGHTEN STOPS
**URGENCY:** HIGH

### IMMEDIATE RISK ASSESSMENT
A 10% single-day drop signals:
- Potential momentum shift
- High volatility environment 
- Elevated risk of further downside

### MONDAY MONITORING CHECKLIST

**🔴 BEARISH SIGNALS (Scale Out Further):**
- Gap down open below previous support
- High volume sellin

### NEO
**Recommendation:** BUY | **Confidence:** 50%

I understand you're asking about IREN, but I'm NEO - the macro analysis specialist focused on gold and currency correlations. IREN appears to be an individual stock, which falls outside my expertise area.

However, I can analyze the **EURJPY 1H chart** you've shared from a macro perspective:

## MACRO ANALYSIS - EURJPY

**MACRO BIAS: BULLISH**
- Clear uptrend with strong momentum into 183.90+ levels
- Risk-on sentiment suggested by JPY weakness
- EUR showing relative strength despite ECB dovishn

### FOMO
**Recommendation:** BUY | **Confidence:** 50%

Looking at this EUR/JPY chart, I can see a dramatic spike followed by what appears to be exhaustion patterns forming.

**EXHAUSTION LEVEL: 9/10**
**SENTIMENT: EXTREME GREED** 
**FOMO SCORE: 85**
**REVERSAL PROBABILITY: 75%**
**RECOMMENDATION: FADE**

## Analysis:

**Exhaustion Signs:**
- Massive vertical spike with minimal pullback
- Candles showing long upper wicks in recent sessions
- Volume appears elevated during the spike
- Price has moved "too far too fast" from recent consolidation levels

### CHART
**Recommendation:** BUY | **Confidence:** 50%

Looking at this EUR/JPY 1H chart, I can see clear technical structures forming:

**PATTERN**: Ascending Triangle / Bull Flag consolidation
**TREND**: UP - STRONG  
**SUPPORT**: 183.270, 183.150, 182.950
**RESISTANCE**: 183.900-184.000 (multiple test zone)
**BREAKOUT LEVEL**: 184.050

### SEQUENCE
