   Score: 79/100 (HIGH)

Additionally, the volume ratio is 2.0x the 20-day average, suggesting high volume on this move, potentially indicating capitulation or exhaustion. Lastly, the stock is currently -38.7% from its 52W High, which could be a potential reversal point. The gap of -5.0% today also adds to the possibility of a bounce.
   Fund: CRM is a quality tech blue chip with no recent earnings misses or guidance cuts. The selloff aligns with broader tech sector rotation amid macro concerns, not company-specific issues. Oversold levels and strong fundamentals suggest mean reversion potential.
   Entry: $209.80-$216.22

🔴 TOP FADE SETUPS (Short the rip):

#1 IREN @ $59.84
   Move: +14.3% (3d) | RSI: 67
   Score: 71/100 (MEDIUM)
   Tech: The stock is currently at a high of its 52-week range and has shown significant price movements in the past few days. The RSI value is not extremely overbought (66.7), but it's still within the overbought territory which could indicate potential for a correction. The high volume ratio compared to the 20-day average also suggests some level of exhaustion. However, the absence of a gap fill today might slightly reduce the score.
   Fund: Parse error
   Entry: $59.24-$61.04
   Target: $53.86 | Stop: $62.83

#2 CIFR @ $17.70
   Move: +7.3% (3d) | RSI: 56
   Score: 63/100 (MEDIUM)
   Tech: The stock is currently at a high of its 52-week range with an RSI of 55.7 which indicates it might be overbought. The high volume on the recent move could suggest exhaustion. However, the -6.7% one-day change and -0.4% today's gap indicate a potential short-term reversal. It is recommended to consider a fade strategy.
   Fund: P/E ratio is N/A indicating potential lack of earnings or profitability, suggesting structural issues. Recent move may not be fundamentally justified without earnings data.
   Entry: $17.52-$18.05
   Target: $15.93 | Stop: $18.59
