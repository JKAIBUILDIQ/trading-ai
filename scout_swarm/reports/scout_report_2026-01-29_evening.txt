🔴 TOP FADE SETUPS (Short the rip):

#1 CLSK @ $12.59
   Move: +1.2% (3d) | RSI: 54
   Score: 67/100 (MEDIUM)
   Tech: The stock is currently not extremely oversold (RSI 53.7) and it's not at its 52-week high or low extremes. However, the stock is close to its 52-week high with a distance of -46.7%, which suggests potential for a correction. The gap today also indicates some selling pressure. Therefore, a 'FADE' might be considered.
   Fund: Stock's minor 1.2% rise in 3 days lacks clear fundamental catalyst. P/E of 11.2 suggests reasonable valuation, but no evidence of oversold blue-chip status or sector rotation. No reported earnings misses or structural issues, but insufficient data to confirm high-quality fundamentals.
   Entry: $12.46-$12.84
   Target: $11.33 | Stop: $13.22

#2 CIFR @ $17.70
   Move: +7.3% (3d) | RSI: 56
   Score: 63/100 (MEDIUM)
   Tech: The stock is currently at its 52-week high, indicating it may have reached an extreme point. The RSI of 55.7 is not extremely overbought but still suggests some level of overbought conditions. The high volume on the recent move could suggest exhaustion. However, the gap today is minimal and doesn't significantly contribute to a potential reversal. Therefore, it might be a good opportunity to consider 'FADE'ing this stock.
   Fund: P/E ratio is N/A indicating potential unprofitability or structural issues; no clear fundamental catalyst for the move; lacks quality company characteristics.
   Entry: $17.52-$18.05
   Target: $15.93 | Stop: $18.59
