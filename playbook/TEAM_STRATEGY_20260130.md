# 🥇 NEO - GOLD STRATEGIST (MGC)

## THESIS: BULLISH SuperTrend Intact

### Current Assessment:
- **Trend:** SuperTrend BULLISH on H1/H4/D1
- **Position:** 76 contracts, near break-even ($5,434)
- **Today's Move:** +$56.90 (+1.1%)

### NEO's Strategy for Tomorrow:

```
HOLD ALL 76 CONTRACTS
- We are in profit zone now
- SuperTrend confirms bullish bias
- No reason to exit
```

### Key Levels:
| Level | Price | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Support 1 | $5,380 | Add 5 contracts if touched |
| Support 2 | $5,340 | Add 10 contracts (DCA) |
| Resistance 1 | $5,450 | Partial TP: 10 contracts |
| Resistance 2 | $5,500 | Partial TP: 20 contracts |
| Target | $5,600 | Scale out remaining |

### Sweep Protection:
```
IF gold drops to $5,300-5,340 intraday:
  - This is a SWEEP, not a reversal
  - SuperTrend must BREAK on D1 to change bias
  - DCA opportunity, not panic zone
  
IF SuperTrend flips bearish on D1:
  - Reduce position by 50%
  - Wait for confirmation before full exit
```

### NEO's Confidence: HIGH (85%)
> "Gold is in a macro bull market. FOMC volatility created the dip, smart money accumulated. We ride the trend, not fight it."

# 👩‍💼 CLAUDIA - BTC MINERS STRATEGIST (IREN/CLSK/CIFR)

## THESIS: BULLISH - AI Hyperscaling Narrative + BTC Decoupling

### Current Assessment:
- **IREN:** Decoupled from BTC, Microsoft $9.7B deal transforms thesis
- **CLSK/CIFR:** Lagging but will follow if IREN leads
- **Earnings:** IREN Feb 5 is the key catalyst

### CLAUDIA's Strategy for Tomorrow:

#### IREN (Lead Position):
```
HOLD ALL CALLS
- Gap fill to $63 still expected (65-75% probability)
- Today's dip was stop hunt, thesis intact
- Feb 5 earnings will confirm AI pivot
```

| Level | Price | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Support 1 | $58.50 | Add calls if retested |
| Support 2 | $56.00 | Aggressive add (key level) |
| Gap Fill | $62-63 | Partial TP: 40 contracts |
| Extension | $65+ | TP remaining Feb 13 calls |
| Stop | $54.00 | ALERT only, don't panic sell |

#### CLSK/CIFR (Laggards):
```
HOLD - NO NEW ENTRIES
- Wait for IREN to break $62 first
- These will follow on sympathy
- Time decay is the enemy (Feb 13 expiry)
```

### Sweep Protection:
```
IF IREN drops to $56-57 intraday:
  - This is MM sweep for liquidity
  - Check: Did IREN break on NEWS or just price action?
  - No news = sweep = opportunity
  
IF IREN breaks $54 with volume:
  - Thesis weakened
  - Reduce Feb 13 calls (closest expiry)
  - Hold Feb 20 and Mar 6 (more time)
```

### CLAUDIA's Confidence: HIGH (80%)
> "IREN is no longer a BTC miner. It's an AI infrastructure play. The Microsoft deal changes everything. 90-day correlation data proves decoupling."
